# Manual Setup Required

## GitHub Actions Workflow

The comprehensive CI/CD pipeline has been created but requires manual addition due to GitHub App workflow permissions.

### Action Required

A repository administrator needs to manually add the following file:

**File**: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
**Location**: Available in the working directory
**Content**: Complete 8-stage CI/CD pipeline with security scanning

### Workflow Features

The pipeline includes:
- 🔍 Security vulnerability scanning (Bandit, Safety)
- 📊 Multi-Python version testing (3.10, 3.11, 3.12)  
- 🔒 Security validation (os.popen checks, API key handling)
- ⚡ Code quality enforcement (Black, Flake8, isort, MyPy)
- 🧪 Automated test execution with coverage reporting
- 📦 Build validation and package verification
- 📋 Dependency security auditing
- 📈 Performance monitoring
- 📝 Documentation checks

### Manual Steps

1. Copy `.github/workflows/ci.yml` from the working directory
2. Add it to the repository via GitHub web interface or with appropriate permissions
3. The workflow will automatically run on pushes and pull requests

### Alternative

The repository is fully functional without the GitHub Actions workflow. All security features, tests, and quality controls are available via:
- `python run_tests.py` (comprehensive test suite)
- Pre-commit hooks (automated quality checks)
- Manual security validation scripts

The workflow simply automates these existing capabilities in a CI/CD pipeline.
