## Abstract
This research explores the integration of quantum computing concepts into classical machine learning frameworks. We propose quantum-enhanced neural network architectures that leverage quantum superposition and entanglement to process information more efficiently than classical approaches. The focus is on applications in scientific discovery, where complex optimization landscapes and high-dimensional parameter spaces present significant challenges for traditional methods.

The research will investigate:
1. Quantum-inspired activation functions and layer architectures
2. Quantum entanglement-based feature representation
3. Hybrid classical-quantum training algorithms
4. Applications to materials discovery and drug design

Expected outcomes include improved convergence rates, better handling of local minima, and enhanced performance on scientific optimization problems.
