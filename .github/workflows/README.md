# GitHub Actions Workflows

This directory contains GitHub Actions workflow files for CI/CD automation.

## Workflow Files to Add

Due to GitHub App permissions, the following workflow files need to be added manually by a repository administrator:

### 1. CI/CD Pipeline (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
- Code quality checks (linting, formatting, type checking)
- Multi-matrix testing (unit, integration, performance)
- Security scanning (SAST, dependency scanning)
- Build and packaging automation
- Docker image building
- Automated deployment to staging/production

### 2. Security Scanning (`.github/workflows/security.yml`)
- Daily vulnerability scans
- Container security scanning
- Secret detection
- Dependency vulnerability checks

## Key Features

- **Quality Gates**: Automated code quality enforcement
- **Multi-Platform Testing**: Linux, multiple Python versions
- **Security-First**: Comprehensive vulnerability scanning
- **Performance Monitoring**: Automated benchmarking
- **Deployment Automation**: Staging and production pipelines
- **Semantic Releases**: Automated versioning and changelog

## Setup Instructions

1. Repository administrator adds workflow files with `workflows` permission
2. Configure secrets for API keys and deployment credentials
3. Enable GitHub Actions if not already enabled
4. Set up required environments (staging, production)

## Benefits

- **Faster Development**: Automated quality checks and testing
- **Enhanced Security**: Continuous vulnerability monitoring
- **Reliable Deployments**: Automated CI/CD with quality gates
- **Better Collaboration**: Standardized development workflows
