## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously and appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose any security vulnerabilities.

### How to Report

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities to:
- **Email**: security@terragonlabs.ai
- **Subject**: [SECURITY] AI Scientist v2 Vulnerability Report

### What to Include

When reporting a vulnerability, please include:

1. **Description**: A clear description of the vulnerability
2. **Impact**: The potential impact and attack scenarios
3. **Reproduction**: Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
4. **Environment**: Version, operating system, and configuration details
5. **Suggested Fix**: If you have ideas for how to fix the issue (optional)

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status Updates**: Every 72 hours until resolution
- **Security Advisory**: Published after fix is available

### Responsible Disclosure

We follow responsible disclosure practices:

1. We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours
2. We will provide regular updates on our investigation and resolution progress
3. We will notify you when the vulnerability is fixed
4. We will publicly acknowledge your contribution (unless you prefer anonymity)

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **API Keys**: Never commit API keys to version control
2. **Environment Variables**: Use `.env` files and keep them secure
3. **Updates**: Keep AI Scientist v2 updated to the latest version
4. **Sandbox**: Run experiments in isolated environments
5. **Access Control**: Limit access to the AI Scientist installation

### For Developers

1. **Input Validation**: Validate all inputs, especially from LLMs
2. **Sandboxing**: Use containerization for experiment execution
3. **Secrets Management**: Use proper secrets management systems
4. **Logging**: Implement comprehensive audit logging
5. **Dependencies**: Regularly update dependencies and scan for vulnerabilities

## Security Features

### Built-in Security

- **Input Sanitization**: All user inputs are sanitized
- **Code Execution Sandboxing**: Experiments run in isolated containers
- **API Rate Limiting**: Protection against abuse
- **Authentication & Authorization**: Role-based access control
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive security event logging

### Security Scanning

We use multiple security scanning tools:

- **SAST**: Static Application Security Testing with CodeQL and Semgrep
- **DAST**: Dynamic Application Security Testing
- **Dependency Scanning**: Automated vulnerability detection in dependencies
- **Container Scanning**: Docker image vulnerability scanning
- **Secret Scanning**: Detection of exposed credentials

### Compliance

Our security practices align with:

- **OWASP Top 10**: Web application security risks
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework**: Industry standard practices
- **CIS Controls**: Critical security controls
- **SOC 2 Type II**: Security, availability, and confidentiality

## Security Architecture

### Multi-Layer Defense

1. **Network Layer**: 
   - TLS encryption for all communications
   - Network segmentation and firewalls
   - VPN access for administrative functions

2. **Application Layer**:
   - Input validation and output encoding
   - Authentication and session management
   - Authorization and access controls

3. **Data Layer**:
   - Encryption at rest and in transit
   - Data classification and handling
   - Backup and recovery procedures

4. **Infrastructure Layer**:
   - Hardened container images
   - Regular security updates
   - Infrastructure as code with security policies

### Threat Model

We protect against:

- **Code Injection**: Through LLM-generated code execution
- **Data Exfiltration**: Unauthorized access to research data
- **Denial of Service**: Resource exhaustion attacks
- **Privilege Escalation**: Unauthorized access to system functions
- **Supply Chain Attacks**: Compromised dependencies

## Security Configuration

### Recommended Settings

```yaml
# Security configuration
security:
  # Enable sandbox mode for all code execution
  sandbox_enabled: true
  
  # Maximum execution time for experiments (seconds)
  max_execution_time: 300
  
  # Maximum memory usage per experiment (MB)
  max_memory_usage: 4096
  
  # Disable network access for experiments
  network_access_enabled: false
  
  # Enable comprehensive audit logging
  audit_logging: true
  
  # Rate limiting configuration
  rate_limiting:
    api_requests_per_minute: 60
    llm_requests_per_minute: 30
    experiments_per_hour: 10
```

### Environment Hardening

1. **Container Security**:
   ```dockerfile
   # Use minimal base images
   FROM python:3.11-slim
   
   # Run as non-root user
   USER aiscientist
   
   # Remove unnecessary packages
   RUN apt-get purge -y --auto-remove
   ```

2. **File System Security**:
   ```bash
   # Set proper permissions
   chmod 600 .env
   chmod 700 experiments/
   chown -R aiscientist:aiscientist /app
   ```

## Incident Response

### Response Plan

1. **Detection**: Automated alerts and monitoring
2. **Analysis**: Threat assessment and impact evaluation
3. **Containment**: Immediate threat mitigation
4. **Eradication**: Root cause elimination
5. **Recovery**: Service restoration
6. **Lessons Learned**: Post-incident review
