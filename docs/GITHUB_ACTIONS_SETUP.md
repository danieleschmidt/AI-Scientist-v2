# GitHub Actions Workflow Setup

This document provides the GitHub Actions workflow files that need to be added manually by a repository administrator due to permission requirements.

## Required Permissions

To add these workflow files, you need:
- Repository admin access
- GitHub App with `workflows` permission (if using a GitHub App)

## Workflow Files to Create

### 1. CI/CD Pipeline

Create `.github/workflows/ci.yml` with comprehensive CI/CD automation:

**Features:**
- Code quality checks (Black, isort, flake8, mypy)
- Multi-matrix testing (Python 3.11/3.12, unit/integration tests)
- Security scanning (Bandit, Safety, Trivy, CodeQL)
- Performance benchmarking
- Docker image building
- Automated deployments

**Key Benefits:**
- Automated quality gates
- Security-first development
- Reliable deployments
- Performance monitoring

### 2. Security Scanning

Create `.github/workflows/security.yml` for dedicated security automation:

**Features:**
- Daily vulnerability scans
- Container security scanning
- Secret detection
- Dependency vulnerability checks
- SARIF results upload

### 3. Required Setup Steps

1. **Add Workflow Files**: Repository admin creates the workflow files
2. **Configure Secrets**: Add API keys and deployment credentials
3. **Enable Actions**: Ensure GitHub Actions is enabled
4. **Set Up Environments**: Configure staging/production environments
5. **Branch Protection**: Set up required status checks

### 4. Benefits of Full CI/CD Setup

- **Quality Assurance**: Automated code quality enforcement
- **Security**: Continuous vulnerability monitoring
- **Reliability**: Automated testing and deployment
- **Efficiency**: Reduced manual processes
- **Collaboration**: Standardized development workflows

## Getting the Full Workflow Files

The complete workflow files are available in the SDLC implementation and can be recreated based on the comprehensive CI/CD configuration documented in this repository's development standards.

Contact the repository maintainers for the complete workflow file contents or refer to the SDLC automation documentation.
