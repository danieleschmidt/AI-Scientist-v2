# Release Automation Workflow

This document describes the advanced release automation workflow for AI Scientist v2, designed for an enterprise-grade SDLC process.

## Overview

The release automation system provides:
- Semantic versioning based on conventional commits
- Automated changelog generation
- Multi-environment deployment pipeline
- Security scanning and compliance checks
- Rollback capabilities
- Release artifacts management

## Workflow Implementation Guide

### 1. Semantic Release Configuration

Add to `.github/workflows/release.yml`:

```yaml
name: ðŸš€ Release Automation

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      release_type:
        description: 'Release type'
        required: true
        default: 'auto'
        type: choice
        options:
          - auto
          - patch
          - minor
          - major
          - prerelease

jobs:
  release:
    name: Semantic Release
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.repository == 'SakanaAI/AI-Scientist-v2'
    
    outputs:
      released: ${{ steps.semantic.outputs.new_release_published }}
      version: ${{ steps.semantic.outputs.new_release_version }}
      
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          
      - name: Setup Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: '3.11'
          
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install python-semantic-release
          
      - name: Security Scan
        run: |
          pip install bandit safety semgrep
          bandit -r ai_scientist/ -f json -o bandit-report.json
          safety check --json --output safety-report.json
          
      - name: Run Tests
        run: |
          pip install -r requirements.txt
          python -m pytest tests/ --cov=ai_scientist --cov-fail-under=75
          
      - name: Build Package
        run: |
          python -m pip install build
          python -m build
          
      - name: Semantic Release
        id: semantic
        run: |
          semantic-release publish
        env:
          GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          PYPI_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.PYPI_TOKEN }}
```

### 2. Multi-Environment Deployment

Configure progressive deployment across environments:

```yaml
  deploy-staging:
    needs: release
    if: needs.release.outputs.released == 'true'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment: staging
    
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to Staging
        run: |
          echo "Deploying version ${{ needs.release.outputs.version }} to staging"
          # Add staging deployment logic
          
  deploy-production:
    needs: [release, deploy-staging]
    if: needs.release.outputs.released == 'true'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment: production
    
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to Production
        run: |
          echo "Deploying version ${{ needs.release.outputs.version }} to production"
          # Add production deployment logic
```

### 3. Release Quality Gates

#### Security Quality Gate
- Container vulnerability scanning with Trivy
- SAST scanning with Semgrep
- Dependency vulnerability checking with Safety
- Secret detection with detect-secrets

#### Performance Quality Gate
- Benchmark regression testing
- Memory usage validation
- API performance testing
- Load testing for critical paths

#### Compliance Quality Gate
- License compatibility checking
- SBOM generation and validation
- Audit trail generation
- Regulatory compliance verification

### 4. Rollback Strategy

```yaml
  rollback:
    if: failure()
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Automatic Rollback
        run: |
          echo "Rolling back release ${{ needs.release.outputs.version }}"
          # Add rollback logic
          kubectl rollout undo deployment/ai-scientist
          docker tag ai-scientist:${{ env.PREVIOUS_VERSION }} ai-scientist:latest
```

### 5. Release Notification

```yaml
  notify:
    needs: [deploy-production]
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Notify Stakeholders
        run: |
          curl -X POST "${{ secrets.SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL }}" \
            -H 'Content-type: application/json' \
            --data '{
              "text": "ðŸš€ AI Scientist v${{ needs.release.outputs.version }} successfully deployed to production!",
              "blocks": [
                {
                  "type": "section",
                  "text": {
                    "type": "mrkdwn",
                    "text": "*AI Scientist v${{ needs.release.outputs.version }}* has been deployed to production.\n\n*Key Features:*\n- Automated scientific discovery\n- Enhanced performance optimizations\n- Security improvements"
                  }
                }
              ]
            }'
```

## Release Types

### Automatic Release (default)
- Analyzes commit messages using conventional commits
- Determines version bump automatically
- Generates changelog from commit history

### Manual Release
- Allows explicit version specification
- Useful for emergency releases
- Requires manual changelog updates

### Pre-release
- Creates alpha/beta releases
- Used for testing before main release
- Tagged with pre-release identifier

## Security Considerations

1. **Release Signing**: All releases are signed with GPG keys
2. **Artifact Verification**: SLSA attestation for supply chain security
3. **Environment Isolation**: Staging and production are isolated
4. **Access Control**: Release permissions limited to core maintainers
5. **Audit Trail**: All release activities are logged and auditable

## Monitoring and Observability

Post-release monitoring includes:
- Application performance metrics
- Error rate tracking
- User experience monitoring
- Infrastructure health checks
- Business metrics tracking

## Emergency Procedures

### Hotfix Release
1. Create hotfix branch from main
2. Apply fix and create PR
3. Emergency release workflow bypasses some checks
4. Immediate deployment to production
5. Post-deployment verification

### Rollback Procedure
1. Automatic rollback triggers on deployment failure
2. Manual rollback available via workflow dispatch
3. Database migration rollback if applicable
4. User notification of service restoration

## Integration Points

- **JIRA**: Automatic ticket updates on release
- **Confluence**: Release notes publication
- **PagerDuty**: Release event creation
- **DataDog**: Release markers for monitoring
- **Slack**: Team notifications

This advanced release automation ensures reliable, secure, and compliant releases while maintaining the velocity required for AI research and development.
